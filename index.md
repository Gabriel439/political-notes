# Notes

This is a collection of notes that I share with people when discussing
politics.  Feel free to contribute your own fixes and improvements by clicking
the Edit button at the top of each page.

If you are a power user, you can add new notes by:

* … cloning [this repository](https://github.com/Gabriel439/notes),
* … using [the `neuron` tool](https://github.com/srid/neuron) to create one or
  more new notes, and:
* … [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your change.
