The book is written by a social scientist and is supported by social science
research.  Moreover, the author takes pains to avoid injecting their own bias
and to let the evidence speak for itself.

The book presents the following synopsis of the right-wing authoritarian
personality, which has:

> 1) a high degree of submission to the established, legitimate authorities in
> their society;
>
> 2) high levels of aggression in the name of their authorities; and
>
> 3) a high level of conventionalism.

You should read the book if you are interested in understanding some of their
more surprising behaviors such as:

* despising certain groups of people when they are otherwise mild mannered
* holding authority figures to a lower moral standard than themselves
* engaging in mental gymnastics to support inconsistent beliefs

The book also presents some long-term solutions for mitigating authoritarian
tendencies, including:

* Civically engage with them on common ground

  Don't just talk, though; do volunteer work side-by-side with them.  According
  to the book, this helps build trust with them, and if they work alongside
  enough non-authoritarian people their desire to be more "normal" will kick in
  and tamper down their authoritarian leanings.

* Make minorities more visible

  Evidence shows that nothing improves their attitudes towards the "out group"
  more than knowing them first-hand instead of via the news or social media.

* Higher education

  â€¦ which exposes them to a more diverse group of people, further reinforcing
  the previous effect.

* Anti-discrimination laws with enforcement

  Authoritarians are highly submissive to legal boundaries that are strictly
  enforced.  Laws can also give authoritarians with doubts about their beliefs
  an excuse to defy their peers.

* Modeling good behavior and leadership

  Authoritarians tend to follow the crowd, even when they have their doubts, but
  one leader breaking from the crowd can give authoritarian followers the excuse
  they need to follow their private conviction.

* Non-violent protest

  Violent protest triggers the authoritarian defense mechanism to punish the
  "out group" in order to protect the "in group".
