Expanding the number of Representatives is a U.S. political reform with a high
power-to-weight ratio.  Currently 435 Representatives serve in the House, and
one estimate from 2018 identified 930 Representatives as one possible sweet
spot:

Expanding the size of the House of Representatives improves U.S. politics in
several ways, by:

* … making the House of Representatives more representative

  Limiting the House to 435 Representatives skews the representation of smaller
  states (both positively and negatively).  For example, Montana only gets one
  Representative per ~989,000 voters, whereas Rhode Island gets one
  Representative for ~526,000 (almost twice the Representatives per capita).

* … making the Electoral College more representative

  Each state receives one elector per Representative and one elector per
  Senator, so increasing the number of Representatives increases the number of
  electors, fixing similar disparities when voting for President.

  The increase in electors also makes the Electoral College more democratic in
  another way.  Every state receives two electors that correspond to their two
  Senators and increasing the total number of electors dilutes the influence
  of the two electors that state gets for free (which disproportionately
  benefits smaller states).

* … increasing the likelihood of passing the [National Popular Vote][popular-vote]

  Making the Electoral College more representative increases the likelihood
  of passing the National Popular Vote, an interstate compact that takes
  effect when ratified by a group of states representing a majority of electors.
  As the name suggests, ratifying the National Popular Vote converts the vote
  for President into a popular vote without the need for a Constitutional
  amendment.

* … improving the responsiveness of Representatives to constituents

  Increasing the number of Representatives from 435 to 930 would decrease the
  number of constituents they represent from ~708,000 people / Representative
  to ~331,000 people / Representative.  The smaller number of constituents
  allows Representatives to be in closer touch with the needs of the people
  they represent and more easily process
  [constituent services][constituent-services].

* … reducing the influence of money in politics

  Fewer constituents means that Representatives can run cheaper campaigns,
  which in turn makes them less beholden to moneyed interests.

Moreover, changing the size of the House of Representatives does not require
a Constitutional amendment and only requires Congress to pass a new law, making
this one of the most effective political reforms.
