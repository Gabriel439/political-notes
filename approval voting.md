Approval voting is a voting method that provides a high power-to-weight
ratio, meaning that the voting method improves voter satisfaction compared to
most alternatives, with low switching costs and a simpler scoring algorithm.

If switching costs don't matter, then score voting is strictly superior to
approval voting.  Approval voting is a special case of score voting where you
can only select one of two scores for each candidate.

You should [[[prefer approval voting over ranked-choice voting]]] because
approval voting is simpler and leads to strictly superior voter satisfaction.
