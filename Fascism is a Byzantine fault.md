A minority of fascists can orchestrate a legal coup against a government that is
ostensibly governed by majority rule.  Specifically, no known system of
government can withstand 1-in-3 people actively betraying that government.

This is a consequence of computer science research into managing consensus in a
distributed systems of machines.  One important result of distributed systems
research is that no known distributed system can withstand a
[Byzantine fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) where 1-in-3
machines actively work against the consensus protocol.

If you view our system of government as a distributed system (where the
"machines" in this case are people), then fascism is a Byzantine fault in that
system.  If fascism gathers the support of 1-in-3 voters, then no system of
government can maintain its integrity against that onslaught.

The reason why Byzantine faults can undermine a system without a majority is
that they assault the very protocols that are used to ascertain consensus.
For fascism, that includes:

* Corrupting the administration of elections
* Exploiting legal loopholes or grey areas
* Installing partisan judges
* Spreading misinformation

This is the reason why you'll often see support for fascist administrations
hover just above the 33% mark, because that is the threshold where fascism
becomes politically viable.
