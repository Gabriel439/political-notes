Duverger's law is the reason why U.S. voters select one of the two leading
candidates when voting tactically, even if a third-party candidate would
better represent their interests.  This behavior arises out to fear of
[vote splitting][vote-splitting]

One consequence of Duverger's law is that you can improve the viability of
third-party candidates by changing the voting system.  For example,
[[Approval voting]] is more resistant to vote splitting and therefore more
conducive to third-party candidates.
